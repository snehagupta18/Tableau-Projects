**Project Description**

This is a visually striking HR Analytics Dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of employee data within an organization. The dashboard effectively utilizes a dark color scheme with contrasting accents to enhance readability and visual appeal.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) are prominently displayed, including employee count, attrition count, attrition rate, active employees, average age, and attrition by gender. These metrics offer a quick snapshot of the overall workforce health.

The dashboard features various visualizations to explore employee data in depth. A pie chart illustrates department-wise attrition, highlighting areas with higher turnover rates. Bar charts depict the distribution of employees across different age groups and job satisfaction levels. Additionally, a bar chart and pie charts analyze the relationship between education field, attrition, and gender across different age groups.

This dashboard serves as a valuable tool for HR professionals to identify trends, analyze employee data, and make informed decisions to improve workforce performance and retention.
